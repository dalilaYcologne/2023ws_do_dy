The core notion is simple: Rather than increasing human capital or physical assets, the most successful 21st-century companies leverage information and technology to achieve rapid expansion in pursuit of a "Massive Transformational Purpose" (MTP). In doing so, they're able to scale their business strategies, culture, organizational frameworks and purpose at the same rate as the technology, i.e. one that follows an exponential curve.

"An Exponential Organization is one whose impact or output is disproportionately large -- at least 10 times larger -- compared to its peers because of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies. In other words, it grows faster, bigger and cheaper than its competition because it has a Massive Transformative Purpose and scales as quickly as tech does."

"The Massive Transformative Purpose is bigger than a mission statement; it's why you do what you do, why you get up in the morning and why your organization exists. It's a higher, aspirational purpose, and it's about thinking big. Radical transformation is its goal. Examples of some great MTPs include Boston Children's Hospital ("Until Every Child is Well"); Best Friends Animal Rescue ("Save them All"); TED ("Ideas Worth Spreading"); and Google ("Organize the World's Information"). These are big, ambitious, grand challenges and the directional north star for their respective organizations."

SCALE, a group of five attributes focused on connecting and keeping abundance
Staff on Demand: Relies on a pool of prequalified workers hired on an as-needed basis to conduct operational elements of your core business. Responsibilities range from simple tasks to complex work and may even include mission-critical processes.

Community & Crowd: Communities are made up of a large global group of individuals (or entities) who are passionate about your MTP and are directly involved in the main functions of your organization. They are loyal to a shared goal and devoted to solving the grand challenges surrounding your organization‘s MTP. Crowd is made up of an even larger global group of individuals— including infrequent users—who have some passive interest in your MTP but are not (yet) directly connected to your organization.

Algorithms: To automate what people do, so the business grows without increasing staff at the same pace. Algorithms allow products and services to be fully scaled and improve quality by finding better solutions to problems—through decision support systems. Also, algorithms provide organizations with new capabilities that not even humans would be able to provide, so it’s not only about automation but also about doing new things that weren’t possible before.

Leveraged Assets: Similar to Staff on Demand, the Leveraged Assets attribute gives you on-demand access to resources, replacing the need for ownership. This also allows the organization to become much more dynamic, flexible and grow as much as needed really quickly.

Engagement: The use of techniques such as reputation systems, gamification, loyalty programs and incentive prizes to keep these groups interested, involved and increasingly committed to your shared purpose.

IDEAS, a group of five attributes focused on managing abundance to grow
Interfaces: The main idea is to make the complex simple, and it can be either what your users interact with or what other systems interact with. For users, the user interface (UI) is the visual part of the software application that they see and the user experience (UX) is the way they interact with the system. For systems, application programing interfaces (APIs) are the code-based connections your systems will have with external (or internal) systems in order to gather and exchange data and functionality.

Dashboards: It provides the real-time information you need to run your business. ExOs use dashboard with non-traditional metrics, such as innovation accounting and indicators focused on tracking the process towards the purpose. Actually, it’s not about how to show the data (this is not new) but about what’s the type of data that should be shown.

Experimentation: The activity of validating assumptions before making significant investments into the organization or new ideas. Each experiment creates a set of learnings that can be used to improve products or services.

Autonomy: The use of self-organized, multi-disciplinary teams that operate with decentralized authority. Autonomy can be also applied to staff on demand or even users, providing them with the freedom to operate more independently, thereby offering the organization greater potential for exponential growth.

Social Technologies: It is about improving internal operations by encouraging social interaction via technology—which includes communications, collaboration and workflow—and exploring how to do this well.
